# elixir-boilerplate
Boilerplate for using Laravel Elixir without Laravel

To install dependencies you need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed and just run

    npm install
    
Gulp should be installed globally with

    npm install gulp -g
    
After that it can be run in the project directory directly to build once or continuously to watch for changes:

    gulp watch
    
In this example this will also run browsersync. See gulpfile.js for more information.
